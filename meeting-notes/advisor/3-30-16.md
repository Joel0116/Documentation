## Agenda Items

**1. Review and approve the minutes of the previous week's meeting**

- Since, last week was Spring break we didn't have an advisor meeting.

**2. Review prior week's progress (sprint accomplishments and issues)**

- The back end is functional and primary components are working.
- The general layout, map, audio, asset list, and how the end points are documented are all done in the iOS version.
- The "Asset Add" is partially working on the Android version.
- Android Layout has been established.
- We switched from coding in PHP to DJango on the back end because it implements the MVC architecture better and is easier to maintain.
