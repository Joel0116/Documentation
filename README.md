# CSC 190 Project

This can be our central repository for everything in this class. The idea is to utilize git for managing:

- Papers
- Agenda
- Meeting Notes 
- Documentation, PRD, SRS
- Source Code
- Resources
- List of contributors

## Papers

## Agenda

This is a general calendar for the events, meetings, due dates that may be coming up. This only should be used to communicate deadlines. When the events have passed, they should be removed from this list for ease of viewing.
